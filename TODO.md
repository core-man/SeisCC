# TODO

- [ ] Update usage in each code and README.md

- [ ] Revise some variable names in each code, e.g., `t0` and `t1`

- [ ] Add some pre-processing flag in each code, e.g.,

    - rmean
    - rtrend
    - filter

- [ ] Add a interpolation flag in each code either by coding in or call third party codes

    - SAC's interpolate
    - lagrange interpolation
